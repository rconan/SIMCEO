# SIMCEO

**SIMCEO** is a client/server application to run Dynamic Optical Simulations (**DOS**) for the GMT.
The server acts as a remote interface for [`CEO`](https://github.com/rconan/CEO).

A simulation takes as parameter the path to the directory that contains the simulation configuration and parameter files.
A new simulation is invoked first by starting the server:
```python
>>> python simceo.py
```
Then, in a different terminal, the client is invoked with:
```python
>>> import dos
>>> sim = dos.DOS(path_to_config_dir)
>>> sim.start()
```
An any time, the status of the simulation can be checked by calling:
```python
>>> sim.pctComplete
```
that return the simulation percentage to completion.

Or by checking the logs:
```python
>>> sim.logs
```

# Install

## Cutting edge

SIMCEO server and client along with the reference manual are contained in the `simceo.nw` file.
The server is extracted with `make server`.
The client module `dos` is build with `make client`.
`noweb` needs to be installed to build both.

## Releases

Alternatively, you can download the latest [release](https://github.com/rconan/SIMCEO/releases) DOS-x.x.tar.gz where the source files have already been generated.
To install SIMCEO, perfom the following steps:
```shell
tar zxf DOS-x.x.tar.gz
cd DOS-x.x
python setup.py install
```

# DOS configuration

Each simulation is defined by a set of YAML files gather in the same directory.
The simulation configuration is always given by the `dos.yaml` file.
Some parameters are given a default value.
If the simulation use the same values, they need not to be set.

```yaml
simulation:
  sampling frequency: # [Hertz]
  duration: # [seconds]
  server:
    IP: # 127.0.0.1
drivers:
  device name:
    server: true
    delay: 0 # [sample]
    sampling_rate: &update_rate 1 # [sample]
    inputs:
      input name:
        size: 0
        lien: # [device, device output name]
    outputs:
      output name:
        sampling_rate: &output_rate *update_rate # [sample]
        size: 0
        lien: # [device, device input name]
        logs:
          decimation: *output_rate # [sample]
```

## Atmosphere driver

If an atmosphere need to be included in the simulation, then the atmosphere driver must be the first in the list of drivers and the atmosphere parameters are listed in the `atmosphere.yaml` file.

```yaml
drivers:
  atmosphere: {}
```
The `atmosphere.yaml` file sets the main parameters of the atmosphere.
The atmospheric Cn2 and wind vector profiles correspond to the GMT median profile from Goodwin data.
```yaml
# The Fried parameter [m]
r0: 0.15
# The outer scale [m]
L0: 30.0
# The size of the phase screen at the ground [m]
L: 25.5
# The resolution of the phase screen at the ground [pixel]
NXY_PUPIL: 321
# The field of view that defines the size of the phase screen above ground [arcsec]
fov: 0.0
# The time span of the phase screen [second]
duration: 10
# The filename where to store the phase screens, if the file exist it is loaded automatically
filename: phase_screen_meaningfull_name.bin
```

## Mirror drivers

The section of a mirror driver is either `M1` or `M2` and the parameters of a mirror are in either `M1.yaml` or `M2.yaml`.
There are only inputs to the mirrors:

 * the 3 rigid body translations of each segment: `Txyz`
 * the 3 rigid body rotations of each segment: `Rxyz`
 * the tip and tilt of each segment: `Rxy`
 * the piston of each segment: `Tz`
 * the mirror mode shape coefficients: `modes`

```yaml
drivers:
  M1:
    inputs:
      Txyz:
        size: [7,3]
      Tz:
        size: [7,1]
      Rxyz:
        size: [7,3]
      Rxy:
        size: [7,2]
      modes:
        size: [7,n_mode]
  M2:
    inputs:
      Txyz:
        size: [7,3]
      Tz:
        size: [7,1]
      Rxyz:
        size: [7,3]
      Rxy:
        size: [7,2]
      modes:
        size: [7,n_mode]
```
Both `M1.yaml` and `M2.yaml` have the same syntax.
State represents the initial state of M1 and M2 segments: translation `Txyz`, rotation `Rxyz` and modal coefficients `modes`.
If the degrees of freedom are only the rigid body motions, then the file is:
```yaml
mirror: # M1 or M2
mirror_args: {}
state:
  Txyz:
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
  Rxyz:
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
```

if the mirror modes are included, then the file becomes:
```yaml
mirror: # M1 or M2
mirror_args:
  mirror_modes: # zernike ,Karhunen-Loeve or bending modes
  N_MODE: # The number of modes
state:
  Txyz:
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
  Rxyz:
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
    - [0.0e-06,0.0e-06,0.0e-06]
```

## Optical path driver

An optical path is composed of a source and a wavefront sensor.
The optical path consists in the atmosphere if it is specified, the GMT and the wavefront sensor.
The optical path section of a driver has only outputs.
*If an interaction matrix is made between the WFS and some degrees of freedom of M1 and/or M2, the name of one output must match the name given to the interaction matrix.*
There are a few outputs that provides wavefront and image quality information:

 * `wfe_rms`: the wavefront standart deviation [micron]
 * `piston`: the piston over the whole GMT pupil [micron]
 * `segment_piston`: the piston associated to each segment [micron]
 * `tiptilt`: the wavefront finite difference average over the whole GMT pupil [arcsec]
 * `segment_tiptilt`: the wavefront finite difference average over each segment [arcsec]
 * `PSSn`: the normalized point source sensitivity
 
 Attributes of the source and the wavefront sensor can be passed as outputs.

```yaml
driver:
  name:
    outputs:
      calibration name:
        size: [n,m]
      wfe_rms: # micron
        size: 1
      piston: # micron
        size: 1
      segment_piston: # micron
        size: 7
      tiptilt: # arcsec
        size: 2
      segment_tiptilt: # arcsec
        size: 14
      PSSn:
        size:1
```

The parameter file contains the source, sensor and calibration parameters.
```yaml

  photometric_band: # the source wavelength, one of V,R,I,J,K
  zenith: # the source zenith angle [rd]
  azimuth: # the source azimuth angle [rd]

    value: # the source zenith angle
    units: # the angle units, degree, arcmin, arcsec or mas
  azimuth:
    value: # the source azimuth angle
    units: # the angle units, degree, arcmin, arcsec or mas

```

## Edge sensors

The edge sensor driver represents M1 edge sensors as modeled in CEO.

```yaml
driver:
  outputs:
    deltas:
      size: 48
```

The associated parameter file is

```yaml
edge sensors:
  error_1sig_per_m: 125.0e-09 # the edge sensor measurement noise (0.5micron/m at 95% confidence interval)
interaction matrices: 
  calibrations:
    <calibration name>:
      args:
        stroke: #
  pseudo_inverse:
    n_threshold: # the number of truncated eigen values [list]
  filename: # the filename where the calibration matrix is stored, if it exist it is loaded automatically
```

## Controller driver

A controller can be placed between a sensor and a mirror.
The controller runs on the client side of the application, `server` must then be set to `false`.
The inputs are given as a list with the sensor section name and sensor output name.
The outputs are given as a list with the mirror name and mirror input name.

```yaml
driver:
  ctrlr name:
    server: false
    inputs:
      input data:
        lien: [sensor,output]
    outputs:
      output data:
        lien: [mirror,dof]
```

The `ctrlr name.yaml` file contains the controller parameter as

 * the numerator and denominator coefficients of the transfer function in the Z domain [n,d]
 * the zeros, poles and gains of the transfer function [z,p,g]
 * a state space representation [A,B,C,D]
 
```yaml
system:
  sampling time: # The sampling time [second]
  transfer function:
    num: [...] 
    denom: [...]
```
